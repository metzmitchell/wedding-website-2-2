# Wedding Website Copy - Annotated for Implementation

## HERO SECTION (app/page.tsx - Main heading and intro paragraph)
**Location: Lines 32-40 in app/page.tsx**

Hey everyone!

We made this little site to share some details about our wedding and give you a glimpse into our lives together! We’re eloping in one of our favorite spots in the WNC mountains on August 21st, and while we won’t be having a traditional in-person wedding, we still wanted to bring you in on the celebration!

This intimate ceremony feels really special and personal to us. If you’d like to be part of the celebration from afar, please send a short video, audio message, or just a few words with a toast or well-wish for us to read that evening back at our cozy little cabin. Having your voices, love, and support woven into our day will make it even more special!

With love,
Sarah & Mitch

## OUR STORY SECTION (app/our-story/page.tsx - Eclipse Story section)
**Location: Lines 35-50 in app/our-story/page.tsx**

Ya'll may remember 8/21/17 as the day with the total solar eclipse, but to us, its our anniversary and the day we shared our first kiss! We had been hanging out for a little while at that point and had gone on some adventures, but that night, after spending the day watching the eclipse and then floating in the lake looking at the stars we had the most magical first kiss! So the timing, the date, the setting - it all felt right for our wedding too! 

## OUR MARRIAGE SECTION (app/our-marriage/page.tsx - Main content)
**Location: Lines 20-29 in app/our-marriage/page.tsx**

8/21/25 Bear Creek Lake
Its not the lake where we started but it holds a special place in our hearts. We have spent many some days hanging out, camping, and boating around. Some of our favorite nights were camping there, just the two of us, making tacos around the fire and chatting about our lives and our futures. [the elopement lake photo]

Our ceremony will take place at the mouth of a river that leads into the lake, on a small little island surrounded by tall mountainsides. Its such a lovely and intimate place that perfectly captures the essence of our relationship - grounded in nature, surrounded by beauty and deeply personal.

This place reminds us that the most meaningful moments in life often happen in the simplest settings, surrounded by nothing but nature and love.

After exchanging our vows, we'll retreat to our cozy rental on the lake. There  we'll spend our first evening as a married couple reading your toasts and heartfelt messages, letting the joy of the day sink in as the sun sets over the water. It will be a simple celebration, but one that perfectly reflects who we are and the life we want to build together.

## REGISTRY SECTION (app/registry/page.tsx - Main content)

We don't have a registry – we have everything we need. 
Some of our loved ones have asked so if you feel like you want to give a gift, we have been saving for our first home! Sarah has been on zillow for years now and we are hoping to buy within the year because we have outgrown our little one bedroom home in downtown asheville.
