Hey everyone! If you're reading this, its because we are extremely grateful to have you in our lives. We're hoping this website gives you a glimpse into our relationship and the little family we are creating. We are going to elope in one of our favorite places in WNC, and to bring everyone into our celebration without an in person wedding, we would love to hear some well wishes or toasts to read that evening! Please send us a short video, audio message or just a few words!

## OUR STORY SECTION (app/our-story/page.tsx - Eclipse Story section)
**Location: Lines 35-45 in app/our-story/page.tsx**

Yall may remember 8/21/17 as the day with the total solar eclipse, but to us, its our anniversary and the day we shared our first kiss! We had been hanging out for a little while at that point and had gone on some adventures, but that night, after spending the day watching the eclipse and then floating in the lake looking at the stars we had the most magical first kiss! So the timing, the date, the setting - it all felt right for our wedding too! 

We are equal parts minimalistic and simple, and hopelessly sentimental. On the surface, a big wedding with all of our friends and family could be cool, but deep down it was too complicated and stressful for us. It also feels intense to put the burden of travel on all of you, especially  with the baby boom in the last few years with our friends and family members. We dont have them, but we imagine it adds an extra layer to it. Underneath it all though, we are total cheeseballs who want all the romance and connection! This duality led to our seven wedding weekends concept! 

## OUR MARRIAGE SECTION (app/our-marriage/page.tsx - Main content)
**Location: Lines 20-25 in app/our-marriage/page.tsx**

8/21/25 Bear Creek Lake
Its not the lake where we started but it holds a special place in our hearts. We have spent many some days hanging out, camping, and boating around. Some of our favorite nights were camping there, just the two of us, making tacos around the fire and chatting about our lives and our futures. [the elopement lake photo]

Our ceremony will take place at the mouth of a river that leads into the lake, on a small little island surrounded by tall mountainsides. Its such a lovely and intimate place that perfectly captures the essence of our relationship - grounded in nature, surrounded by beauty and deeply personal.

This place reminds us that the most meaningful moments in life often happen in the simplest settings, surrounded by nothing but nature and love.

After exchanging our vows, we'll retreat to our cozy rental on the lake. There  we'll spend our first evening as a married couple reading your toasts and heartfelt messages, letting the joy of the day sink in as the sun sets over the water. It will be a simple celebration, but one that perfectly reflects who we are and the life we want to build together.

## REGISTRY SECTION (app/registry/page.tsx - Main content)
**Location: Lines 15-25 in app/registry/page.tsx**

We don't have a registry – we have everything we need. 
Some of our loved ones have asked so if you feel like you want  to give a gift, we have been saving for our first home! Sarah has been on zillow for years now and we are hoping to buy within the year because we have outgrown our little one bedroom oasis in downtown asheville.
