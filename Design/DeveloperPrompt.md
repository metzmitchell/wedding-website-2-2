**Wedding Date**: August 21, 2024 (already passed - building as a keepsake)  
**Target Users**: Non-tech-savvy family members primarily using mobile phones

## Development Environment

- **Starting Template**: (already installed) https://github.com/ansh/template-2 (social media app template)
- **Environment**: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, ShadCN components
- **Database**: Firebase (Firestore + Storage)
- **Development Tool**: Claude Code within Replit

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (CRITICAL - Complete with user before coding) ( I think I've already completed all of this, so just need to check that it works)
1. Fork the template repository in GitHub
2. Import into Replit
3. Set up Firebase project (Firestore, Storage, optionally Auth)
4. Configure all environment variables
5. Verify connectivity and test the base template

### Phase 2: Core Development
**Priority Features** (in order):
1. **Name Entry System** - Simple form for guest identification
2. **Text Toast Submission** - Basic well-wishes with public/private toggle
3. **Toast Display Feed** - Social media style card layout
4. **Photo Upload** - With compression and preview
5. **Video Upload/Recording** - File upload and browser recording
6. **Static Pages** - Story, elopement details, registry

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy
- Mobile optimization (primary platform)
- Error handling and loading states
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## Key Design Principles

1. **Book-Like Aesthetic**: Every page should feel like a beautifully crafted magazine spread
2. **Mobile-First**: Most guests will use phones - this is the primary experience
3. **Generous White Space**: Let content breathe with ample margins
4. **Subtle Animations**: Fade effects only - no complex movements
5. **Personal Voice**: Casual tone throughout, avoiding wedding clich√©s

## Technical Requirements

- **Performance**: Visual richness prioritized over raw speed
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers, iOS Safari priority
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, large touch targets
- **Responsive**: True mobile-first with graceful desktop enhancement

## Important Notes

1. **Existing Template Modification**: You'll be adapting a social media app template - remove authentication in favor of simple name entry
2. **Media Storage**: Firebase Storage (integrated)
3. **AI Disclaimer**: Include footer note about AI-built site as specified
4. **No Post-Wedding Updates**: Site should be self-contained after launch

## Getting Started

1. First, review the **DeveloperPrompt.md** for detailed technical guidance
2. Examine the **ComponentSpecs.md** for exact component implementations
3. Reference individual page prompts for specific content and features
4. Use **VisualDirection.md** for all styling decisions

The design team has created a complete specification - your role is to bring this vision to life with clean, functional code that serves the couple's guests beautifully. Focus on the core well-wishes functionality first, as this is the primary purpose of the site.
