# Wedding Website Design Summary

## Project Overview
We've created a comprehensive design specification for Mitch & Sarah's wedding website that transforms a typical wedding site into an elegant digital keepsake. The design captures their personality while serving the practical purpose of collecting well-wishes for their elopement ceremony.

## Design Philosophy
**Core Concept**: A digital experience that feels like reading through a cherished photo album or personal memoir, with each page feeling like turning pages in a beautifully crafted book.

## Key Design Decisions

### Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic**: Magazine-like elegance with handcrafted, personal touches
- **Typography**: Source Serif Pro throughout for warmth and readability
- **Color Palette**: Warm terracotta primary with soft cream backgrounds
- **Photography**: Single images with generous white space, gallery-style presentation
- **Animations**: Subtle fades only - luxury feel without complexity

### User Experience
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for non-tech-savvy family members on smartphones
- **Navigation**: Simple, book-like table of contents approach
- **Interactions**: Minimal and intuitive
- **Accessibility**: Large touch targets, clear contrast, simple flows

### Content Strategy
- **Voice**: Casual, personal tone from Mitch - avoiding wedding clichés
- **Structure**: Clear hierarchy with emotional storytelling
- **Primary Goal**: Collecting well-wishes through multiple formats
- **Personal Touches**: AI disclaimer, quirky domain story

## Final Thoughts

This design successfully transforms a functional need (collecting well-wishes for an elopement) into an emotional experience that reflects Mitch & Sarah's personality. By treating the website as a digital keepsake rather than a temporary wedding tool, we've created something that will age gracefully and remain meaningful long after the wedding day.

The book metaphor provides a familiar mental model that reduces cognitive load for non-technical users while creating an elevated aesthetic that matches the couple's vision of an elegant, magazine-like experience. Every design decision supports both the practical goals and the emotional journey, resulting in a cohesive, purposeful design that tells their story beautifully.
