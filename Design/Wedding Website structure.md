# Wedding Website Structure

**Domain:** pumpkinspumpkinspumpkinsandmore.com  
**Wedding Date:** August 21, 2024  
**Location:** Bear Creek Lake, NC  
**Brand Voice:** Like you're reading a note directly from Sarah & Mitch, written by Mitch. Very casual. Not cheesy wedding stuff.

## Design & User Experience

### Visual Aesthetic
- **Style**: Elegant like reading a magazine or memoir - handcrafted and personal
- **Layout**: Lots of white space, shadows, sections that feel like book pages
- **Images**: Minimal presentation with white space around photos - single photos speak for themselves
- **Photo Content**: ~20 smartphone shots of outdoor/camping/hiking scenes, mostly portrait aspect ratio

### User Journey & Goals
- **Primary Goal**: Visitors submit well-wishes through toast page features
- **User Flow**: Arrive → poke around → watch homepage video → view other toasts → read story/wedding details → submit their own toast
- **Target Audience**: Mobile-first, not tech-savvy guests
- **Desired Feeling**: Relaxed, like reading a book with pictures of a nice story

### Technical Approach
- **Animations**: Subtle fading animations only - luxury/high-end feel, polished and smooth
- **Performance**: Visual richness prioritized over speed - compressed photos, no data usage concerns
- **Updates**: No content updates needed after wedding

## Purpose of the Wedding Website:
- Share what we're doing for our elopement
- Share our story and journey together
- Ask for well-wishes that will be part of our ceremony
- Provide a way for people to contribute financially (house fund)
- Create a virtual asynchronous toast experience

## Global Site Elements
- **Header:** Mitch Metz & Sarah Robinson
- **Primary CTA:** Share your well wishes
- **Footer:** As a side note, Mitch coded this entire website using AI, so some features might or might not work.
