Hello friends and family. We are extremely grateful to have all of you in our lives. This website gives you a glimpse into the family we're creating together.

Please send us a short video, audio message, or written note!

### About Our Wedding
We're eloping in one of our favorite spots in the Western North Carolina mountains on August 21st. After the ceremony at the lake, we'll head back to our cabin and spend the evening reading and listening to messages from all of you. Together we'll discuss what we want our marriage to look like and the type of family we want to be, then create a living document of these intentions.

We want to bring you into this moment by hearing what you have to say – think of it as a virtual asynchronous toast. Your advice and well wishes will be part of setting our intentions for our lives together.

### Story Text
(more coming soon)
August 21st, 2017 was the day of a huge solar eclipse. During that amazing summer day, while we'd been seeing each other for a little while and had gone on a couple hikes, we shared our first kiss after swimming at a mountain lake. The timing, the date, the setting – it all felt right for our wedding too.

We're equal parts minimalistic and hopelessly sentimental. On the surface, we're savers who don't like spending much money and don't want to burden everyone with expensive travel for our wedding. Underneath, we're total cheeseballs who want romance. This duality led to our seven wedding weekends concept.

## Our Marriage Page

### Main Content
Our story weaves through lakes and mountains. We're eloping at Bear Creek Lake – this spot in the Western North Carolina mountains that's captured our hearts. The picture you'll see here shows us at the very lake where we'll exchange vows.

We'll say our promises and set intentions for our lives together and the family we're creating. Our cabin rental for several days gives us space to transition together after the ceremony. Back at our vacation spot, we'll read and listen to messages from family and friends, then set our wedding agreements and discuss the type of family we want to be, documenting it all as a living guide.

Several days of just being together feels like the right way to make this transition. A mountain lake provides the perfect setting.

Our little motorboat will carry us to the mouth of a beautiful river flowing around a grassy island into this small lake surrounded by cliffs. After reading the vows we've prepared for each other, we'll return married. Simple beauty.

## Registry Page

### Main Content
We don't have a registry – we have everything we need. Since we didn't make you travel, and we're already set for daily life, we're focusing on saving for our first house with mountain views and hopefully an office that isn't doubling as our laundry room.

If you'd like to contribute to the "future adventures" fund, here's the information, though absolutely no pressure:

**Venmo:** @(enter)
**Mailing Address:** 28 Claxton PL AVL, NC

Your love and presence in our lives is the real gift.

## Family Gathering Page (Past Event)

### Header
Our Wedding Weekends – Family Gathering in Asheville

### Main Content
We're celebrating with multiple special weekends – the union of our families plus our own union through several little honeymoons, all leading to the private ceremony at our favorite WNC Mountains spot.

This particular day focused purely on celebrating our family. Our excitement centered on everyone meeting each other – the main agenda was simply recognizing how lucky we all are to have each other.

### Event Details

**Activities:**
Yard games, disposable cameras, and a memory book. We gathered everyone together briefly for a few words and attempted a group photo.

**Attire:**
Since Sarah's middle name is Jean, our dress code was "as much denim as you feel like wearing." 
(chuck Norris photo, then photos of us)

**Food:**
Coffee & mocktail bar ran from 3-5, followed by appetizers and charcuterie, then dinner from 5-6. The upscale southern menu was grazing-style, so people could choose what they wanted and return for seconds.

## This Website Page

### Main Content
As a marketer, I love finding truly terrible branding. I call Sarah "Pumpkin," and during a long drive, I started imagining the worst possible brand name: "Pumpkins Pumpkins Pumpkins and More." I imagine a 90's store crossing Party City with Bed Bath & Beyond, then adding ".com" to their name during the 2000's rebrand. Complete with horrible Toys R Us color scheme. Maybe someday I'll create a fake online store for it.

So naturally, we bought the domain.

**Video:** Building the site (timelapse of the coding process) - prominent core feature of this page

Built during late nights fueled by coffee and AI assistance. Watch the timelapse if you enjoy seeing code break and get fixed in real time.

## Notes for After Video Recording
- Replace video placeholders with actual recordings
