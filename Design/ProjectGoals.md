# Project Goals

## Project Overview
A personal wedding website for Mitch & Sarah's elopement that serves as a virtual gathering space for family and friends. The site will share their story, collect well-wishes for their ceremony, and provide details about their unique "seven wedding weekends" celebration approach.

## Primary Objective
Create an elegant, book-like digital experience that allows guests to participate in the couple's intimate elopement ceremony through submitted well-wishes, while sharing their love story in a personal, non-traditional way.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Demographics**: Family and friends of all ages, particularly older relatives not tech-savvy
- **Needs**: Easy way to share congratulations, understand the couple's non-traditional wedding approach, feel included despite not attending
- **Pain Points**: May struggle with complex interfaces, need clear guidance for video/audio uploads
- **Device Usage**: Primarily mobile phones, some tablets/desktops

### Secondary Users
- **The Couple**: Will use submitted content during their ceremony, need easy access to all messages

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- [ ] 80%+ of invited guests submit a well-wish (text, audio, or video)
- [ ] Mobile bounce rate under 20%
- [ ] Average session duration over 3 minutes
- [ ] Video upload success rate over 90%

### Qualitative Goals

## User Journey Mapping

### Primary User Flow
```
Homepage Video → Browse Well-Wishes → Read Our Story → Visit Toast Page → Submit Message → View Registry
```

### Critical Touch Points
1. **First Impression**: Homepage video immediately humanizes the experience
2. **Activation Moment**: Reading other guests' well-wishes inspires participation
3. **Completion**: Successfully submitting their own message

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: Under 3 seconds (visual richness prioritized over speed)
- Video player: Must load quickly with poster image
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance
- Browser support: Modern browsers, iOS Safari priority

### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile**: Primary platform, portrait orientation, touch-optimized
- **Tablet**: Secondary, should scale gracefully
- **Desktop**: Tertiary, maintain elegance with more white space

### Integration Requirements
- File upload system for video/audio messages
- Form submission handling
- Basic content management for well-wishes

## Business Requirements

### Brand Alignment
- **Brand Values**: Personal, casual, non-traditional, slightly quirky
- **Tone**: Like reading a note from Mitch, avoiding wedding clichés
- **Differentiation**: More like a personal journal than typical wedding site

### Conversion Goals
- **Primary CTA**: "Share your well wishes"
- **Secondary CTAs**: Watch videos, read story sections
- **Funnel Optimization**: Minimize friction in submission process

### Compliance & Legal
- [ ] Privacy options for submitted content
- [ ] Basic data handling for submissions
- [ ] Clear submission guidelines
