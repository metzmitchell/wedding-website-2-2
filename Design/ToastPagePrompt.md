## Responsive Behavior

- Full-featured media controls

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column for options
- Stacked layout throughout
- Simplified media interfaces
- Touch-optimized controls

## User Flow & Interactions

### Selection Flow
1. User clicks option card
2. Card highlights with border/background
3. Corresponding form fades in below
4. Smooth scroll to form if needed

### Submission Flow
1. User completes form
2. Loading state during processing
3. Success message appears
4. Form resets or option to add another
5. If public, message appears in feed

### Success Feedback
```
Container: bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6
Icon: Check circle
Message: "Thank you! Your toast has been received."
Additional: "We'll read your message on our wedding night."

Duration: Shows for 5 seconds or until dismissed
```

### Error Handling
```
Inline validation for required fields
Clear error messages below fields
Friendly language: "Oops! Please add your message"
Retry options for failed uploads
```

## Technical Considerations

### Form Validation

- Message: Required for text option
- File size limits clearly shown
- Format restrictions communicated

- Chunked upload for reliability
- Fallback options if upload fails
- Clear file size/format requirements

### Data Privacy
- Clear indication of public vs private
- No message shown without permission
- Secure handling of personal messages
- GDPR considerations if applicable

## Performance Optimization

### Media Handling
- Compress videos client-side if possible
- Lazy load feed messages
- Thumbnail generation for videos
- Audio waveform generation (optional)

### Form State
- Persist form data in localStorage
- Clear indication of saved drafts
- Prevent data loss on navigation

## Edge Cases

### No JavaScript
- Basic HTML form fallback
- File upload still functional
- Graceful degradation

### Slow Connections
- Show progress clearly
- Allow pause/resume for uploads
- Timeout handling with clear messaging

### Multiple Submissions
- Allow users to submit multiple messages
- Clear flow to add another
- No confusion about what was sent

## Accessibility Features

### Form Labels

- Associated with inputs correctly
- Error messages linked to fields

### Media Controls
